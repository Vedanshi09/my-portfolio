        <h1>Skill Rise</h1>
        <p>Motivated by the pressing challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, we identified a critical issue: declining satisfaction ratings and a 10% decrease in enrollment within education institutions. The prolonged isolation resulting from the pandemic has hindered students from acquiring crucial skills, specifically in communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. Recognizing the urgency to address this problem, we devised a solution: SKILL RISE. <br>
          <br>
          Introducing SKILL RISE, a revolutionary web app empowering graduating students to overcome Covid-19 challenges. We enhance confidence, communication, and workforce readiness. With a comprehensive platform, SKILL RISE cultivates essential skills like teamwork and conflict resolution for professional success. Our mission is to foster personal and professional growth, empowering students to thrive in the post-pandemic era.<br>
          <br>
          To develop this website, we employed various approaches, including personal ideation, storyboarding, and wireframing. Utilizing the powerful tools offered by Adobe Creative Cloud, my team and I seamlessly created a visually appealing layout for our website.<br>
